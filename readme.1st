 - Add Alias example file to package
 - Reorganize "What's New" section in help to place the latest
 changes at the top of the pages.
 - Fix @eawrite[] so it deletes EAs when a value isn't provided
 - Fix @eawrite and @earead to trim leading and trailing white
 space from EAnames.
 - Fix @words[] so it returns 0
 - Added internal variable _TMSMP (Time Stamp)
 - Add INI key to specify 4 digit years and 2 digit 2 day
 should be displayed.
 - Add INI key to allow setting the Date Format.
 - Change the default jpstree.idx location to the 4OS2 directory
 with fall back to the root of the boot drive, 
 - Hide LIBPATHSTRICT for environment list when it isn't set.
 - Fix Usage for the DIR and MOVE commands.
 - Fix deletion count when an unsuccessful attempt to abort occurs
 - Allow variables in the TEXT command.
 - Add INI key to prevent duplicates in the history.
 - Bypass internal help for message file help files with numbers

 - Fix to always use an external command with the same name
 as an internal command if .exe is appended to it.
 - Add Shift-Ins paste.

 This also fix a trap with some FOR command lines.
 - Fix REPLACE to accept an empty input string.

 - Ensure that 4os2 understands that given command lines like @ foo.exe
   @ is not an INI file indicator
 - Double max input line length to 2048, needed for compiling some QT4 stuff
   (by Andreas for Elbert)

 Type on devices
 ---------------

 In contrary to the standard OS/2 type command the 4os2 type command handles
'carriage return' (0x0D, <CR>) characters as 'line feed' in page mode (/P) and
currently ignores it in normal mode.

 Advantage: with weird devices like alsahlp$ no text is lost as with standard
type which overwrites lines immediately when <CR> is encountered

 Disadvantage: with weird devices like alsahlp$ in page mode (/P) when end of
line is marked with a <LF> followed by <CR> instead the usual <CR><LF>, this
will produce intermediate empty lines.

 Anyway you can always redirect output to a file to see what the device really
wants to tell you. Or use "copy alsahlp$ con:" to see it similar than with
cmd.exe (lines are overwritten with <CR>)

 Note: wrnd32$ and some versions of alsahlp$ do not like when reading data
in single byte mode. This mode is used with type options /P and /L. These
devices return none or garbage output in this case. It's not easy to implement
a work around for such weird behaving devices. It's up to the device driver
developers to fix this. In the meantime I can only suggest to not use /P or /L
with such devices.
